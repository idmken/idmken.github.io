This page captures the progress of my dissertation on an identity and access management competency model.

List of dissertation modifications:
1. 03/2021 - My original research topic was focused on a competency model for the U.S. Federal Government. I've modified it to a generic competency model based on cybersecurity workforce planning developed and implemented by the U.S. Federal Government.

# Where have all the Identirati gone? An Identity and Access Management Competency Model

My research aims to establish identity and access management work roles, tasks, knowledge, and skills aligned with a competency model to help organizations hire, train, and retain Identity and Access Management professionals.

## Chapter 2 - Literature Review

A literature review is a scholarly source review related to a specific topic. It provides an overview of the historical background, contemporary context, theories and concepts, previous research and limitations or gaps, and the significance of the issue being researched. My literature review was adapted from [**The Literature Review: A Step-by-Step Guide for Students (SAGE Study Skills Series) by Ridley**](https://www.amazon.com/Literature-Review-Step-Step-Students/dp/1446201430/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/141-5825669-0250349?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1446201430&pd_rd_r=519270a8-c143-4def-9b02-c153a52cae99&pd_rd_w=yJF2F&pd_rd_wg=4N1TU&pf_rd_p=337be819-13af-4fb9-8b3e-a5291c097ebb&pf_rd_r=MAZXGWSSCK99FXCE77YH&psc=1&refRID=MAZXGWSSCK99FXCE77YH){:target=”_blank”}{:rel=”noopener noreferrer”}
