# Digital Identity References

Sources, articles or training to increase our digital identity knowledge. I've read all articles or taken the training and recommend it to others. Recommendation is not an endorsement of a product but more "oh, here's an article on the thing we talked about". All links are external links and ordered with latest find on top. I use this as both a way to share information and also a way to keep track of good content.

- [The Line of Death by Eric Law](https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - When building applications that display untrusted content, security designers have a major problem— if an attacker has full control of a block of pixels, he can make those pixels look like anything he wants, including the UI of the application itself. He can then induce the user to undertake an unsafe action, and a user will be none the wiser. In web browsers (and beyond sometimes), the browser itself usually controls the top of the window, while pixels under the top are under control of the site. I’ve recently heard this called the line of death.
- [Revocation is broken by Scott Helme via Scott Helme Blog (14 min read)](https://scotthelme.co.uk/revocation-is-broken/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} - We have a little problem on the web right now and I can only see this becoming a larger concern as time goes by. More and more sites are obtaining certificates, vitally important documents that we need to deploy HTTPS, but we have no way of protecting ourselves when things go wrong.
