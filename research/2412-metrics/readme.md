1. User Risk Assessment: Monitor user risk levels based on their activities. This could include sign-in attempts from unfamiliar locations, repeated failed sign-in attempts, or other suspicious behavior.
2. Sign-in Monitoring: Track user sign-in activities. This includes successful sign-ins, failed attempts, and the location and device used for sign-in. Unusual sign-in activity could be a sign of a potential security threat.
3. Admin Activity Monitoring: Admin accounts have high-level access and can be a prime target for attackers. Monitor admin activities, especially those involving changes to security settings, user privileges, or access controls.
4. Application Usage Monitoring: Keep an eye on the usage of applications within your organization. Unusual application activity, such as a high number of downloads or an increase in usage outside of normal business hours, could indicate a potential security issue.
5. Privileged Identity Management: Monitor the lifecycle of privileged identities within your organization. This includes the creation, modification, and deletion of privileged accounts.
6. Access Review: Regularly review user access to various resources within your organization. This can help ensure that users only have access to the resources they need for their job functions, reducing the risk of insider threats.
